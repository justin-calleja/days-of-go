This is a series of posts about me practicing / learning the [Go](https://go.dev/) programming language. Each "day" was not necessarily written in a day and the topics covered are ad-hoc based on what I feel I'd like to cover at any particular point in time. They could be of use to others learning the language.

The repo containing everything related to each day (code, write-up, assets), is [here](https://github.com/justin-calleja/days-of-go). Said repo is a [hugo module](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/) which I intend to pull into this [blog](https://github.com/justin-calleja/justincalleja.com/tree/hugo-based).
