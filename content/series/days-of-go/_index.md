title: Days of Go
type: days-of-go
---

This is a series of posts about me practicing / learning the [Go](https://go.dev/) programming language. Each "day" was not necessarily written in a day and the topics covered are ad-hoc based on what I feel I'd like to cover at any particular point in time.

The repo containing everything related to each day (code, write-up, assets), is [here](https://github.com/justin-calleja/days-of-go). Said repo is a [hugo module](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/) which gets pulled into this [blog](https://github.com/justin-calleja/justincalleja.com/tree/hugo-based), which is using [this theme](github.com/justin-calleja/hugo-theme-terminal) (also a hugo module).
